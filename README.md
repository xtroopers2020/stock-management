## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Maven
- MySQL Server
- IDE (e.g., Spring Tool Suite, IntelliJ IDEA)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xtroopers2020/stock-management.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd stock-management
   ```

3. **Set Up the Database**

   Create a new MySQL database named `stock_management`. You can do this using a MySQL client or command line:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE stock_management;
   ```

4. **Configure Database Connection**

   Open the `application.properties` file located in `src/main/resources`. Update the database connection settings as follows:

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/stock_management
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```

5. **Build the Project**

   Use Maven to build the project. Run the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

6. **Run the Application**

   You can run the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it via your web browser. The user interface allows you to:

- Add new stock items
- Update existing stock details
- Delete stock items
- View demand forecasts based on historical data

### User Roles

The application supports multiple user roles:

- **Admin**: Full access to all features.
- **User**: Limited access to stock management features.

### Authentication

To access the application, you need to register as a user. After registration, log in with your credentials. Admin users can manage user roles and permissions.

## Demand Forecasting

The demand forecasting feature uses historical sales data to generate forecasts. The application analyzes trends and provides insights on expected stock levels. This helps businesses avoid stockouts and overstock situations.

### How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The application collects sales data over a defined period.
2. **Analysis**: It applies statistical methods to analyze the data.
3. **Forecast Generation**: The application generates forecasts based on the analysis.

## Data Visualization

The application uses Chart.js to present data visually. Users can view charts that depict stock levels, sales trends, and demand forecasts. This makes it easier to understand data at a glance.

### Chart Types

- **Bar Charts**: For comparing stock levels across different products.
- **Line Charts**: For visualizing sales trends over time.
- **Pie Charts**: For showing product distribution in inventory.

## Testing the API

You can test the REST API endpoints using Postman. The application exposes several endpoints for managing stock items and retrieving forecasts.

### API Endpoints

- **GET /api/stocks**: Retrieve all stock items.
- **POST /api/stocks**: Add a new stock item.
- **PUT /api/stocks/{id}**: Update an existing stock item.
- **DELETE /api/stocks/{id}**: Delete a stock item.
- **GET /api/forecast**: Retrieve demand forecasts.

### Sample Request

To add a new stock item, send a POST request to `/api/stocks` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "name": "Product Name",
  "quantity": 100,
  "price": 9.99
}
```
